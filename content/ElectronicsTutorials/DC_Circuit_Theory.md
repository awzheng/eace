# DC Circuit Theory

# Ohm's Law

## The "Simple English" Definition
> *Current is proportional to Voltage and inversely proportional to Resistance.*

If you want more electricity to flow, you either need to push it harder (more Voltage) or remove the obstacles (less Resistance).

## The Water Analogy
Imagine a garden hose:
* **Voltage (V)** = The water pressure at the tap.
* **Current (I)** = The amount of water coming out of the hose.
* **Resistance (R)** = A kink in the hose or your thumb covering the opening.

## The Formulas
$$V = I \times R$$
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$
$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

## The "Gotcha" (Common Mistakes)
* **Units Matter:** The formula only works if you use **Volts**, **Amps**, and **Ohms**.
* **The Trap:** Questions usually give you Milliamps ($mA$) or Kilo-ohms ($k\Omega$).
* **The Fix:** Always convert first!
    * $10 mA \rightarrow 0.01 A$
    * $4.7 k\Omega \rightarrow 4700 \Omega$
