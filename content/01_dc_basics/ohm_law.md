# Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law is one of the most fundamental relationships in electrical engineering. It describes the relationship between **voltage**, **current**, and **resistance** in an electrical circuit.

## The Formula

$$V = I \times R$$

Where:
- **V** = Voltage (measured in Volts, V)
- **I** = Current (measured in Amperes, A)
- **R** = Resistance (measured in Ohms, Ω)

## Understanding the Relationship

### Voltage (V)
Voltage is the electrical pressure or "push" that causes electrons to flow. Think of it like water pressure in a pipe—the higher the pressure, the more water wants to flow.

### Current (I)
Current is the rate of electron flow through a conductor. In our water analogy, this is the amount of water actually flowing through the pipe.

### Resistance \(R)
Resistance opposes the flow of current. It's like a narrowing in a pipe that restricts water flow.

## Rearranging the Formula

Ohm's Law can be rearranged to solve for any variable:

| To Find | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Voltage | V = I × R |
| Current | I = V / R |
| Resistance | R = V / I |

## Example Problems

### Example 1: Finding Voltage
A circuit has a current of 2A flowing through a 10Ω resistor. What is the voltage across the resistor?

```
V = I × R
V = 2A × 10Ω
V = 20V
```

### Example 2: Finding Current
A 9V battery is connected to a 3Ω resistor. How much current flows?

```
I = V / R
I = 9V / 3Ω
I = 3A
```

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Direct Proportionality**: Current is directly proportional to voltage (more voltage = more current)
2. **Inverse Proportionality**: Current is inversely proportional to resistance (more resistance = less current)
3. **Applies to Linear Resistors**: Ohm's Law only applies to ohmic (linear) devices where resistance is constant

## Thevenin Equivalent

When analyzing complex circuits, Ohm's Law becomes even more powerful when combined with **Thevenin's Theorem**. A Thevenin equivalent circuit simplifies any linear circuit into a single voltage source $V_{th}$ and a single series resistance $R_{th}$, making it much easier to analyze.
